## Fetching Reddit Api with Redux

First of all, special Thanks to Cranework OY for giving me the opportunity to explore about redux and reddit api. 

### `How to run the app:` 

```js
git clone https://github.com/usmanali598/ReduxFetchRedditApi.git
npm install
npm start
```

### `About App:`

This app is basically fetching the images and text from reddit api and present the image gallery. Images and text is updated after every minute so if there is new update in api then gallery will be updated accordingly. 

Moreover, several animations are used as logo of cranework is hanging and moving. Similarly, border is created by covering all four sides on hovering any of the cards(image/text).
